Running the binary causes the memory address of `main` to be printed. This allows us to know where the program is located in memory regardless of what machine the program is running on, by calculating memory addresses relative to `main`.

Using gdb, we can get the addresses of `main` and `win` using `print main` and `print win`, respectively. Subtracting the address of `win` from `main`, we get `0x96`.

Running the program now on the server, we are given the memory address of `main`. Subtracting `0x96` from that address, we now have the memory address of `win`. Providing that value as user input, the program will create a function pointer to that address and call it, resulting in the flag being printed: `picoCTF{b4s1c_p051t10n_1nd3p3nd3nc3_00dea386}`.
