# picoCTF-2025

picoCTF is a cybersecurity/hacking competition hosted by Carnegie Mellon University, and is one of the largest competitions of its kind. 

In this repository, we will be writing up our solutions to the challenges we solve. We were mostly playing for fun, but thought it would be a good idea to document our learning process for future reference.

picoCTF 2025 was held between Mar 7, 2025 and Mar 17, 2025.
