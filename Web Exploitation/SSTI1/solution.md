In this challenge, we are given a website that states "I built a cool website that lets you announce whatever you want!".

Upon writing something in the input box and submitting it, the website displays the text that was entered. This is a classic example of a Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability.

Using the payload `{{7*'7'}}`, the website displays `7777777`. This confirms that the website is using either Jinja2 or Twig as its templating engine.

I found a list of payloads for SSTI [here](https://www.pwny.cc/web-attacks/server-side-template-injection-ssti). There didn't seem to be much input validation or sanitization, as the few payloads I tried all allowed me to execute commands.

I first used `{{ namespace.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('ls').read() }}`, which listed:
```
__pycache__ 
app.py 
flag 
requirements.txt
```

I then used `{{ namespace.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('cat flag').read() }}` to get the flag: `picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_424a1494}`.
