Upon accessing Cookie Monster's site, I was greeted with a username and password prompt. 

Any set of inputs resulted in a message from Cookie Monster: 'Me no need password. Me just need cookies!'

Checking the cookies on the site (`Inspect -> Application -> Cookies`) revealed a cookie named `secret_recipe` with the value `cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzZDMkZCN0YzfQ==`.

The `==` at the end was clearly the padding of a base64 encoded string, so I decoded the value to get the flag: `picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_6C2FB7F3}`
